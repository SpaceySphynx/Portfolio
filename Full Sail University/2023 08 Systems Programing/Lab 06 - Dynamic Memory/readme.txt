Objective
We will be analyzing pre-existing code to fix and clean up memory leaks that use dynamic memory.

Memory Leaks

This project contains multiple memory leaks. Fix them and write a log of your thought process and execution of these fixes in the Debugging Steps.txt file.

ALL FIXES AND CODE CHANGES SHOULD ONLY BE DONE IN THE “TODO STUDENT WORK” FOLDER IN YOUR SOLUTION EXPLORER.
Your goal is to maintain the code’s behavior such that the output does not change and the “Memory In Use” says 0 with a PASS.
