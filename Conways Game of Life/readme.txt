Here I had a month to use C++ with wxWidgets to create my own version of Conway's Game of Life. I have created a GameOfLife.exe of my version and the original Code is located in The Code folder. The game runs long as you also download the accompanying .png images for the icons. 

Explore the settings drop-down menu for lots of fun options for the game. You can also turn on and off lots of the grids and overlays in the view menu. 

The code can be viewed however it will not run unless you download the Binaries from wxWidget's site and place the binaries folder in the same folder as the GameOfLife.sln main file. I could not include this folder as it is 1.5g in size.
